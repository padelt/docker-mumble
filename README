# Thank you for downloading and running the programster mumble container. This will allow you to
# quickly get a mumble server up and running. Note that your mumble server will persist across
# reboots because all the "state" data is stored on the host at /mnt/mumble rather than in the
# container.

# Please note that this is primarily built upon someone elses work at:
# https://github.com/overshard/docker-mumble
# but I have made quite a few modifications to how this is built etc.

# HOW TO BUILD YOUR OWN CONTAINER
# To build your own container from scratch simply execute the following command on your host from
# within this folder.
# bash build.sh

# HOW TO RUN THE CONTAINER
# Copy and paste the following two commands into your docker host to run the container.
# mkdir -p /mnt/mumble .
# sudo docker run -d=true -p=64738:64738 -v=/mnt/mumble:/data programster/mumble-server /start

# SUPERUSER PASSWORD
# To find out what the "SuperUser" password is, you can find it at 
# /mnt/mumble/superuser_password.txt

# Thanks again!
# Programster
